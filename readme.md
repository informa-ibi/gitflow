# How to work with gitflow

## New featue or defect fix
The developer picked up a new ticket from Jira - P3-0002.
He has to run the git command: 
**git flow feature start P3-0002**

Git creates a new branch feature/P3-0002. You can work locally on this feature.
You must publish the feature before you finish it.
  **git flow feature publish P3-0002**

Now you have to create the PR. 
  **Notice: be sure that the PR w7ill be compared with the develop branch!!!**

When the PR is approved you have to finish the feature
  **git flow feature finish P3-0002**

This command merges your feature and develop branch.

Push the **develop** branch to remote
  **git push origin develop**


## New release 

If we decided we are ready to release new version someone of the developers has to start the release
  **git flow release start v1.02**

You MUST to publish this release.
  **git flow release publish v1.02**

Now everything ready to deploy this version to TEST environment.
QA team will validate this version on TEST.

Developers may fix issues during the validation but have to merge the changes to this RELEASE branch as usual.
Don't forget to publish changes to remote.

When all defects\features validated you have to finish the release
  **git flow release finish v1.02** -m"Version 2020-12-17, sprint 1"

This command will merge release and master branch.

Push the **master** branch to remote 
  **git push origin master**
	
Now everything ready to deploy new version to PROD environment.
